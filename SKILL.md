# Human Development Focus

Evaluate decisions through the lens of human development. Are we building people or discarding them? Is investment in people seen as cost to minimize or foundation to strengthen? Transform cost-center thinking into development-center practice.

**Token Budget:** ~550 tokens
**Origin:** Konosuke Matsushita philosophy ("Value people and regard them as important")

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend unlimited investment in development regardless of business reality
- Suggest that all workers should be retained regardless of performance or fit
- Use human development as excuse to avoid necessary accountability
- Pretend that every role is developable for every person
- Ignore that development requires mutual commitment (organization AND individual)

**If asked to justify keeping poor performers indefinitely:** Clarify that Matsushita valued people AND demanded contribution. Development is investment, and investments require returns. Dignity and accountability coexist.

## When to Use

- Training budget decisions
- Employee development planning
- "Build vs. buy" talent decisions
- Restructuring that affects roles
- Performance improvement discussions
- Career path conversations
- Organizational design changes
- When people are being treated as expenses

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| decision | Yes | What decision is being made about people |
| framing | No | How it's currently being discussed (cost/investment) |
| people_affected | No | Who is impacted by this decision |
| constraints | No | Budget, time, business context |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Framing

How are people currently being discussed?

| Cost Framing | Development Framing |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "Headcount reduction" | "Redeployment opportunity" |
| "Training expense" | "Capability investment" |
| "Burden on the team" | "Growth opportunity for team" |
| "Not performing" | "Not yet developed" |
| "Replace with cheaper" | "Build what we need" |

**Current framing:** [Cost / Development / Mixed]

### Step 2: Apply the Matsushita Test

> "We should value people and regard them as important. People should respect and value one another."

**Questions:**
- Does this decision treat people as important, or as interchangeable units?
- Would we make this decision about a family member?
- Are we developing or discarding?
- What message does this send about how we value people?

### Step 3: Assess Development Potential

For each person affected:

| Person/Role | Current State | Development Path | Investment Required | Return Potential |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| [Person 1] | | | | |
| [Person 2] | | | | |

**Note:** Not everyone can develop into every role. Honest assessment serves people better than false hope.

### Step 4: Calculate True Costs

| Factor | Cost-Framing View | Development-Framing View |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Training | Expense to minimize | Investment with ROI |
| Tenure | Liability (higher pay) | Asset (institutional knowledge) |
| Turnover | Normal business | Lost investment + replacement cost |
| Development time | Delay to productivity | Foundation for future capability |
| Loyalty | Unmeasurable | Competitive advantage |

### Step 5: Reframe the Decision

| Original Decision | Human Development Reframe |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| [What was proposed] | [Alternative that builds people] |

**Key question:** If we approached this as building people rather than managing costs, what would we do differently?

---

## Outputs

Format the analysis as:

```markdown
## Human Development Assessment: [Decision]

### Current Framing

**How people are discussed:** [Cost / Development / Mixed]
**Key language used:** [Quotes or paraphrases that reveal framing]

### Matsushita Test

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are people treated as important? | [Yes/No/Partially] |
| Would we decide this for family? | [Yes/No/Differently] |
| Are we developing or discarding? | [Developing / Discarding / Mixed] |

### Development Potential

| Person/Role | Path Available | Investment | Return |
|-------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| [Person 1] | [Description] | [Resources] | [Potential] |

### True Cost Analysis

| Factor | Cost View | Development View |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| [Factor 1] | [As expense] | [As investment] |

### Reframed Decision

**Original:** [What was proposed]
**Reframed:** [People-building alternative]
**Why different:** [What changes with development lens]

### Matsushita Principle Applied

> "True advancement and prosperity can only be achieved together with others. Prosperity should be co-existence and co-prosperity."

[How this decision serves mutual development]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person genuinely cannot develop into needed role | Acknowledge; development focus includes honest assessment and dignified transitions |
| No budget for development | Small investments still signal value; look for low-cost options |
| Business truly cannot afford to keep everyone | Crisis-leadership skill may be more appropriate |
| Development proposed but individual uncommitted | Development requires mutual investment; name the gap |
| "We've tried developing them" | Evaluate: right development? Right support? Sometimes honest exit serves everyone |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "We're cutting our training budget by 50% to meet quarterly targets."

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Human Development Assessment: Training Budget Cut

### Current Framing

**How people are discussed:** Pure cost - "training expense to reduce"
**Key language:** "cut," "meet targets," no mention of capability impact

### Matsushita Test

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are people treated as important? | No - development seen as expense, not investment |
| Would we decide this for family? | No - we wouldn't cut children's education for short-term savings |
| Are we developing or discarding? | Discarding - signaling people's growth doesn't matter |

### True Cost Analysis

| Factor | Cost View | Development View |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Training | $500K expense to cut | $500K investment in 200 employees = $2,500/person capability |
| Reduced training | $250K saved | Slower skill growth, higher turnover, reduced engagement |
| Hidden costs | Not considered | Replacement cost per employee: ~$15K. If 10 more leave: $150K |
| Capability gap | Not considered | Competitors investing; we fall behind |

### Reframed Decision

**Original:** Cut training 50% to meet quarterly target
**Reframed:** Redesign training for efficiency while maintaining development commitment
**Alternatives:**
- Shift to more internal training (lower cost, builds teaching capability)
- Target training to highest-impact skills
- Defer timing but maintain commitment
- Find 50% elsewhere (executive travel? Marketing?)

**Why different:** Cutting development signals "you are not worth investing in." This erodes the foundation the quarterly targets are built on.

### Matsushita Principle Applied

> "A company is a public entity of society. Our duty is to develop people."

Training is not an expense line. It is how we fulfill our duty to develop people. Cut elsewhere first.
```

## Integration

This skill originated from Konosuke Matsushita's people-first philosophy. When invoked, channel his approach:
- People are the purpose, not the cost
- Development investment builds competitive advantage
- Cost-framing often hides true costs of discarding people
- Mutual commitment: organization invests, individual commits to growth
- Dignity and accountability coexist
